## Introduction

In this project, we explore the field of self-driving cars and implement various algorithms and techniques to achieve autonomous driving. The project is inspired by the lectures from the "Self-Driving Cars" playlist on YouTube [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q4WUxgwDeg&list=PL05umP7R6ij321zzKXK6XCQXAaaYjQbzr). 

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/flexycode/self-driving-car.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the self-driving car simulation, execute the following command:

To execute the main.py file in your self-driving car project, follow these steps:

Open a command-line interface (such as Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows).
Navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located using the cd command. For example, if the file is located in the self-driving-car directory on your desktop, you can use the following command on macOS/Linux:
cd ~/Desktop/self-driving-car

On Windows, the command would be:
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\self-driving-car

Once you are in the correct directory, you can execute the main.py file by running the following command:
python main.py

Make sure you have Python installed on your system and the necessary dependencies for your self-driving car project are installed.
The program will start running, and you should see the output or any relevant information printed to the console.

### These projects often provide Python scripts that you can study and learn from. Some popular self-driving car projects include:

* Donkey Car: An open-source DIY self-driving platform using Raspberry Pi and Python.
* Apollo: An open autonomous driving platform developed by Baidu.
* CARLA: An open-source simulator for autonomous driving research.

  
#### These projects contain Python scripts that cover various aspects of self-driving car development, including perception, control, and decision-making algorithms.
